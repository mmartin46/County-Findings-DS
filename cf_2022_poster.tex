\textbf{Question 6} (see Figure (6))\\
Using linear regression, we are able predict
that\\
- Increased alcohol deaths slowly decreases
  the health and social rankings.\\
- Increased drug overdoses remedially increases
  health and social rankings.\\
- Blue Line - Social Ranking and Health Behaviors comparison\\
- Purple Line - Social Ranking and Health Behaviors (\% of Drug-Overdoses considered)\\
- Red Line - Social Ranking and Health Behaviors comparison (\% of Alcohol Deaths considered)\\
\begin{equation}
\boldmath{
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Question 7} (see Figure (7))\\
The \% of teen births with all races shows a higher relationship of an increase of poor mental health days among Indian, Asian, and Black Americans, while ethnicities such as White and Hispanic Americans tend to have a lower amount of poor mental health days that happened to have children as teenagers.

The \% of children that people that have children as teenagers and have children in poverty are usually were mainly minorities, while White Americans tend to have the lowest amount of children in poverty.\\

\headerbox{UHG Questions}{name=subtopic3,column=1,below=introduction,span=1}{
\vspace{0.1cm}
\textbf{Project Objectives}\\\\
- Do income inequality, unemployment and high school completion\\
rates affect the number of premature deaths of certain racial groups\\
at the county level?\\
- Which 5 States have the counties with lowest mental health days, and do\\
excessive drinking ratings lead to larger amounts of people having poor mental \\
health days?\\
- Which counties and states have shown to have the highest average\\
number of alcohol related deaths reported within the health rankings\\
and does this correlate with driving alone to work?\\
- Do high physical inactivity rates found within the rankings tend to\\
correlate with high adult obesity rates?\\
- What are the top 20 counties with the lowest high school completion\\
rates grouped by each state and does this correlate to the number of
teen births?\\

Analyze data set given by United Health Group(UHG) to\\ determine the impact on race, social and demographic factors\\ on health, survival, and mortality.\\

Since the UHG County Findings Dataset was high in storage,
we need to utilize different forms of application software in order to manipulate and visualize the data in order to minimize the time needed to work on the questions for this dataset.
