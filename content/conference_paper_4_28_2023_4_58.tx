\section{Abstract}
The objective of the research project is to
analyze data set given by United Health Group(UHG)[2] in order to develop different predictions that have impacted the country based on race, social and demographic factors.
Through the semester, the students in the Introduction To Data Science course have been working with the County Health Rankings \& Roadmaps 2022 dataset[1]. The dataset, a grouping of information, given involves statistics grouped by ethnicity which consists of various physical factors that have an effect on our environment. Moreover, the task for the students is to attempt to find correlated factors within the dataset that affect the environment to a higher extent. As a result, our group has decided to make use of a computer language called Python in order to use various visualization tools (graphs, charts, geocharts) for our analysis of the dataset. Furthermore, the visualization tools which we have used for our dataset are Pandas[3], Matplotlib[10], Altair[8], Shap[6], and Seaborn[9]. Moreover, we used the tools within sections in the dataset such as “Alcohol Related Deaths”, “YPLL (Years of Potential Life Lost)”, “High-School Dropout Rates”, and we will eventually use machine learning tools, to see if we can find future predictions within our dataset if certain trends continue.\\

Keywords: dataset, data-visualization, Pandas, Altair, Seaborn\\

\section{Dataset(s)}

\subsection{Data Cleanup}
The County Findings Dataset was high in storage, so it was necessary to utilize different forms of application software in order to manipulate and visualize the data in order to minimize the time needed to work on the questions for this dataset (e.g. Pandas, Matplotlib, Altair). Moreover, the team eventually moved to the data cleanup process as many of the columns received from the dataset were "unnamed". [5] The algorithm utilized
sequentially iterates through each column and if the column shows as "unnamed", it will be
changed to a blank column (see Figure A).[5]\\\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{cleaner.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure A}    
\end{center}

Continuing the discussion regarding the data cleanup process, there were plenty of rows that were had no values, which concluded to more problems. Moreover, plenty of rows within the given dataset had values that were left as missing for numerous
countries. As a result, initializing all the values seemed like an optimal option but
led to a numerous amount of results be initialized to zero, so unfortunately when predictive modeling because a strong topic in our research, we had to completely
remove many of the columns in order to get a more accurate predictive model for our dataset.

Additionally, a major problem we had was trying to understand how to match
our dataset with the geomap visualization. Within the dataset some of countries
within our dataset had to be removed due to the software's understood countries
for the United States. As a result, this may have lead to some missing information within the data visualizations. In order to attempt to solve this problem was to manually put in the each state's ID manually, which as a result gave us fuller data visualizations.

The team used the Ranked, Sub-Ranking, and the Additional Measure statistics within the dataset, as these were the only areas that had
any social, physical, and demographic factors that the data visualization tools could make accurate predictions with.



\section{Results}

\subsection{Predictive Model}\\
As we consider what happens in both physical and social environments by splitting our dataset by 80 / 20. We trained
the model and found that in both poor physical and social
environments, they both
lead to a higher amount of poor physical health days. (See Figure A.1)\\


\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{model.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure A.1}    
\end{center}


\subsection{Social \& Economic Findings}

The \% of teen births with all races shows a higher relationship of an increase of poor mental health days among Indian,
Asian, and Black Americans, while ethnicities such as White
and Hispanic Americans tend to have a lower amount of
poor mental health days that happened to have children as
teenagers (See Figure B).\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig2.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure B}    
\end{center}

The \% of children that people that have children as teenagers
and have children in poverty are usually were mainly minorities, while White Americans tend to have the lowest amount
of children in poverty (See Figure C).\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig3.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure C}    
\end{center}


Using a heat-map as an way of visualizing our dataset,
we tend to find that\\
- Quality of Life has a relationship with health behaviours.\\
- Quality of Life also has a relationship with Social & Economic factors.\\
- Social & Economic Factors also tend to have a strong effect on health behaviors.\\
(See Figure D)\\

\subsection{Project Objectives}
\textbf{1. Do income inequality, unemployment and high school
completion
rates affect the number of premature deaths of certain racial
groups?}\\

From the heatmap it can be stated for each
racial group, the highest correlations of premature death is...\\
Asian: Highschool Completion Rate\\
Black: Income Inequality\\
White: Highschool Completion Rate\\
Hispanic: Highschool Completion Rate (See Figure 1)\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Q1.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 1}    
\end{center}

\textbf{2. Which 5 States have the counties with lowest mental
health days, and do
excessive drinking ratings lead to larger amounts of people
having poor mental
health days?}\\

The visualization shows that as poor
mental health lowers, we tend to see
the amount of excessive drinking increases\\
\\
\textbf{States:}\\
West Virginia,
Arkansas,
Alabama,
Tennessee,
Louisiana\\

The graph above shows that as poor mental health lowers, the amount
of excessive Drinking increases.\\
Escaping poor mental health by drowning oneself in alcohol? (See Figure 2)\\


\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Q2.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 2}    
\end{center}

\textbf{3. Which counties and states have shown to have the highest
average
number of alcohol related deaths reported within the health
rankings
and does this correlate with driving alone to work?}\\



The "correlation" legend represents the counties where the 
Percentage of the
- Driving Deaths with Alcohol Involvement	
- Lone Drive to Work

are near idententical.\\
Our findings show that there is a higher corrleation in the northwestern
part of the United States (e.g. Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming)
than in other counties within the United States. (See Figure 3.A)\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Q3.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 3.A}    
\end{center}

\\Our findings also show that there is a correlation with alcohol related driving deaths with people that drive alone to work.
The average is ranges between (8\% - 50\%) of people dying while drinking and driving with around (70\% - 90\%) of people driving alone.
This county findings show us that while it isn't a suprise that many \\individuals drive alone to work, a suprisingly high number of counties have an unecessarily high amount of driving deaths.\\
\\
Could it be possible that this isolated driving tends to lead to unecessary driving deaths? (See Figure 3.B)\\


\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Q3_1.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 3.B}    
\end{center}


Using the correlation formula, we found that 
we receive a value of 0.5446131445201996.
Which shows that there is a relationship between the two factors if the value
is closer to 1 than 0.\\

\begin{center}
\large{
$ Pearson's R = \frac{N\Sigma{XY}-(\Sigma{X}\Sigma{Y})}{\sqrt{ [N \Sigma{x^2}-(\Sigma{x})^2 ][N \Sigma{y^2}-(\Sigma{y})^2 }]} $
}
\end{center}\\\\

Pearson's correlation use for the given dataset is used
as a measure of the linear association between two
factors for our given examples.\\


\textbf{4. Do high physical inactivity rates found within the rankings tend to correlate with high adult obesity rates?}

We find that Obesity and Physical Activity Rates tend to lead to
a YPLL rate of 5,000 to 20,000.
What does this data mean? \\
Our findings show us that both Obesity and Physical Activity
Rates tend to have a similar effect of shortening the length
of American lives.
Another noticeable factor is that individuals that tend to have more poor mental health days within the week tend to also be more

\textbf{
\\- Physically inactive
\\- Obese
\\- Potential years of life lost
}\\
(See Figure 4.A)\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Q4.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 4.A}
\end{center}

We can also compare the amount of poor mental health days for the population within the week with the amount of physical inactivity rates and also see that the coorelation tends to be similar to the obesity rates.\\
(We can find most of the population has 20-40\% of obesity rates and 4-6 days within the week of poor mental health.)\\\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Q4_1.png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 4.B}
\end{center}

As we look more at the correlation between the obesity rates, we tend to find that counties with (30-40\%) of obesity rates tend to have in between (4 - 6) days of poor mental health days.\\

*   Pink - 6-7 poor mental health days within the week\\
*   Red -  $\le$ 3 poor mental health days within the week\\

Even within the outskirts of our data, 
counties that have obesity rates above 40\% within their population tend to have poor mental health days throughout the week.

\end{center}

\textbf{5. What are the top 20 counties with the lowest high school completion rates grouped by each state and does this correlate to the number of teen births?}\\

 Top 20 counties with the lowest high school completion rates, grouped by state:\\
 Texas: Kenedy, Presidio, Hudspeth, Starr, Maverick, Gaines, Culberson, Frio, Garza, La Salle, Moore, Zapata, Brooks, Hidalgo\\
 Ohio: Holmes\\
 Indiana: LaGrange\\
 Idaho: Clark\\
 Mississippi: Issaquena\\
 Kentucky: Clay\\
 Georgia: Atkinson\\
 \\Texas holds almost 3/4's of the lowest 20 Highschool completion States, at 14 out of 20
 Possible reasoning could be its location next to the border?\\
 The graph above shows that as the High School Completion rate drops, the Teen Birth rate
 steadaly rises. There is a correlation of almost 70\%. (See Figure 5)\\

\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 5}
\end{center}


\subsection{Linear Regression}

A problem the group was having regarding predictive modeling was that
the mean squared error, which shows how far off our predictive analysis is compared to the actual data, was usually high. We turned out to use a more efficient method of minimizing the mean squared error by utilizing the MinMaxScaler from the Sckit-learn library within Python.[6] Using this method allowed us the minimize the mean squared error as well as being provided a more accurate looking data visualization for our predictive models.\\

As stated in the introduction, one of the problems that the group confronted was
the missing data in the given dataset. Each time we had to develop a predictive model
we always had missing data. Our solution, while not the most accurate, was to remove
all the rows that did not have a value.\\

\textbf{# Are there demographic and social factors that are predictors of drug
overdose, alcohol-related driving incidents?}\\

Using linear regression, we are able predict that with the percentage of alcohol deaths being factored within each\\ county, we can predict that a higher percentage of alcohol deaths will gradually decrease the social ranking of a county as well as their general health behavior.
\begin{equation}
\boldmath{
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i}
\end{equation}



With the percentage of drug-overdoses considered there surprisingly turns out to be a remedial increase of both the social ranking and the health behavior within each county.\\

\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure 6.B}
\end{center}

Purple Line - Social Ranking and Health Behaviors \textbf{(\% of Drug-Overdoses considered)}\\

In general, if we look at a visualization of all races,
we tend to find that the relationship between Poor Physical Health Days and the
of Preventable Hospital rates tend to be similar, with whites and blacks
having a slight edge in poor physical health days.\\

\section{Additional Research}

\subsection{Findings}

\textbf{An increase in college students is predicted to cause an increase of Calmedia Cases.}\\

The data visualization shows us that as the # of Chlamydia cases increases,
the premature death rate also tends to increase.
Using Kernel Ridge Regression, the algorithm shows us that if we consider the more people take courses in college, it predicts that we may have an increase of chlamydia cases and death rates the more college students we have. (See Figure Z.1)\\

\begin{equation}
\boldmath{
    \hat{\beta} = (X^T X + \lambda I)^-1 X^T y}
\end{equation}

 \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{download (10).png}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize{Figure Z.1}
\end{center}



Using another predictive analysis option,
Random Forest Regression, 
shows us that individuals that had higher math scores usually are expected
to have a longer life expectancy than those
who have lower math scores.

\section{Evaluation}
After learning about our dataset and the given County Health Rankings Model,
there seemed to be more of a misunderstanding as to what outcomes needed
to be evaluated within our dataset. In the Health Rankings Model, utilizing
the Health Factors subcategories were supposed to be the inputs as to what
to use to make predictions on the subcategories of the Health Outcomes.
If the group had more time, separating the data set's factors and outcomes
could have possibly saved the team a greater amount of time as to understanding
what was supposed to be understood within the dataset. On the positive side,
the process of understanding what our dataset was trying to show the team
allowed us to utilize a variety of different software tools to find results
that were not even expected to be found within the dataset. 
At the beginning of the project the main visualization software that was used was Pandas[3] and Altair[8], which allowed us to manipulate and visualize the dataset.
Overtime, utilizing different data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib[5]
and Seaborn[10] allowed the group to find different ways to visualize our dataset.
Moreover, utilizing Sckit-learn's machine learning algorithms[6] and utilizing the
County Health Rankings Model would have made for interesting project objectives that
could have replaced a majority of the questions that were used to find the results
of the given dataset.



\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
Our analysis revealed that we were able to find different situations
in health and social factors based on different ethnicites. As in our 
findings for premature death, we found that Asian, White, and Hispanic
Americans will tend to have premature deaths more frequently if they haven't
completed high school, and for Black Americans we found that Income Inequality
turned out to be a more significant factor. Moreover, utilizing different 
visualizations of our data, were able to find how factors such as 
Quality of Life tend to closely depend on how high a county has ranked within 
Social \& Economic Behaviours and Health Behaviors, as an example.
Additionally, using the University of Wisconsin's model for the specific dataset[1],
we were able to use a variety of factors such as educational, clinical, physical,
and social factors in order to come up with more accurate results for our
health outcomes, allowing our findings to gradually improve as the progress on working on the dataset continued. The group as a result, began using 
different machine learning approaches in order to predict different
outcomes for certain factors of our dataset. (e.g. Linear Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.) using a prediction tool known as SK Learn[6]. Using these machine learning approaches we were able to find how different educational and social factors may have an impact on health behaviours within
different counties.

Future work within the given dataset would more than likely involve
learning more about different machine learning approaches to given
more accurate predictive models for the given dataset. Additionally,
utilizing neural networks have been a strong consideration as to
making our data visualizations possibly more accurate. Moreover, another
consideration is to utilize the 2023 County Health Findings dataset
and possibly use a machine learning oriented approach regarding project
objectives.
