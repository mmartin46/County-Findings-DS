\begin{multicols}{2}
\textbf{Question 1} \small{(See Figure (1))}\\
From the heatmap it can be stated for each\\ racial group, the highest correlations of premature death is...\\                 
\textbf{Asian:} Highschool Completion Rate\\ 
\textbf{Black:} Income Inequality\\
\textbf{White:} Highschool Completion Rate\\
\textbf{Hispanic:} Highschool Completion Rate\\

% Insert question 2
\textbf{Question 2} \small{(See Figure (2))}\\
The visualization shows that as poor\\
mental health lowers, we tend to see\\
the amount of excessive drinking increases.\\
\textbf{Question 3} \small{(See Figure (3))}\\
The "correlation" legend represents the counties where the \\
Percentage of the\\
- Driving Deaths with Alcohol Involvement	\\
- Lone Drive to Work\\
Counties within the northwestern region \\tend to have similar rate of \\alcohol related deaths and lone drivers.\\
(e.g. Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming)\\

\textbf{Question 4} \small{(See Figure (4))}\\
Yes, our findings show us that individuals \\that tend to have more poor mental\\ health days within the week tend to\\ also be more Physically inactive, Obese,\\ and have potential years of life lost\\

% Insert Question 5
\textbf{Question 5} \small{See Figure (5))}\\
Of the top 20 counties with the lowest\\
high school completion rates, 14 of them are\\
located in Texas.\\
\textbf{Texas}: Kenedy\\
\textbf{Ohio}: Holmes\\
\textbf{Indiana}: LaGrange\\

\textbf{Question 6} \small{See Figure (6))}\\
Using linear regression, we are able predict
that\\
- Increased alcohol deaths slowly decreases
  the health and social rankings.\\
- Increased drug overdoses remedially increases
  health and social rankings.\\

\headerbox{UHG Questions}{name=subtopic3,column=1,span=1}{
\vspace{0.1cm}
\textbf{Analysis Objectives}\\\\
\textbf{1.} Do income inequality, unemployment and high school completion\\
rates affect the number of premature deaths of certain racial groups\\
at the county level?\\
\textbf{2.} Which 5 States have the counties with lowest mental health days, and do\\
excessive drinking ratings lead to larger amounts of people having poor mental \\
health days?\\
\textbf{3.} Which counties and states have shown to have the highest average\\
number of alcohol related deaths reported within the health rankings\\
and does this correlate with driving alone to work?\\
\textbf{4.} Do high physical inactivity rates found within the rankings tend to\\
correlate with high adult obesity rates?\\
\textbf{5.} What are the top 20 counties with the lowest high school completion\\
rates grouped by each state and does this correlate to the number of
teen births?\\
\vspace{.05cm}
}

\headerbox{Social \& Economic Findings}{name=pred, column=1, below=subtopic3, span=1}{

The \% of teen births with all races shows a higher relationship of an increase of poor mental health days among Indian, Asian, and Black Americans, while ethnicities such as White and Hispanic Americans tend to have a lower amount of poor mental health days that happened to have children as teenagers.\\
\includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{download (8).png}\\

The \% of children that people that have children as teenagers and have children in poverty are usually were mainly minorities, while White Americans tend to have the lowest amount of children in poverty.\\\\

\headerbox{Project Objectives}{name=obj, column=0, span=1}{
Analyze data set given by United Health Group(UHG) to\\ determine the impact on race, social and demographic factors\\ on health, survival, and mortality.\\

Since the UHG County Findings Dataset was high in storage,
we need to utilize different forms of application software in order to manipulate and visualize the data in order to minimize the time needed to work on the questions for this dataset.

As we consider what happens in both physical and social
environments by splitting our dataset by 80 / 20.
We trained the model and found that in both poor physical and social environments, they both\\
lead to a higher amount of poor physical health
days.
